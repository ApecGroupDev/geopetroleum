The assessment will identify these concerns through methods such as review of regulatory agency information, aerial photographs, historical documents, interviews with previous property owners, and a physical inspection of the property.`,

    description: `While a Phase I ESA is a preliminary investigation, a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment may be required if information collected during a Phase I ESA indicates the possible presence of contamination or if a more in-depth investigation is required. A Phase II ESA typically involves the drilling of exploratory soil borings to obtain soil and/or groundwater samples, which are analyzed at an accredited laboratory.`,

This process analyzes soil, groundwater, and air samples to evaluate at-risk receptors such as drinking water wells or surface water. Sites undergo monitoring and corrective action until all regulatory limits are met.`,
